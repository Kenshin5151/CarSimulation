This project contains mainly Python files for Car Simulation project.

Codes were edited with PyCharm 2020.3 (Community Edition) editor.

The debugger will look for the auto input feed in the file located at "../Input/car_simulation_input.txt". 
This location can be configured in the [Run / Edit Configuration / Configuration / Redirect input from]

"../Input/car_simulation_input.txt" is the data file to be fed to the debugger during execution to automate the manual entry process.


To try different test scenarios, you can copy the content from
    "../Test Cases/[filename.txt]"
to replace the content of
    "../Input/car_simulation_input.txt"
and re-run the execution.


You can run either
    "Code/car_simulation_test.py"    (Log will be created at the "../Output/car_simulation_test.log")
    or
    "Code/car_simulation.py"         (No log created)


To see more execution step details, uncomment 
    line 22 and 
    line 28 
in car_simulation.py

You can now run either
    "Code/car_simulation_test.py"    (Log will now be created at the "../Output/car_simulation.log")
    or
    "Code/car_simulation.py"         (Log will now be created at the "../Output/car_simulation.log")
